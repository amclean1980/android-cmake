CMake is great, and so is Android.  This is collection of cmake scripts, and patches for common libraries that may be useful to the android ndk community.  It is based on experience from porting opencv to android.

Main goal is to share these scripts so that devs that use cmake as their build system may easily compile native code for android.

See http://android-cmake.googlecode.com/hg/documentation.html

This project includes ports of the follow:
  * boost
  * eigen
  * glues

And a few samples, to get you started.

Also, used by the android opencv port: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/AndroidExperimental
